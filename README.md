# My Obsidian Code Snippets

This is a personal collection of CSS snippets and other code I use to customize my [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) vault.

## How to Use

These are primarily CSS snippets for use in Obsidian.

1.  In Obsidian, go to `Settings` > `Appearance`.
2.  Under the "CSS snippets" section, click the folder icon to open your snippets folder (`YourVault/.obsidian/snippets/`).
3.  Copy any of the `.css` files from this repository's `Obsidian/css` directory into that folder.
4.  Go back to Obsidian and click the "Reload snippets" button (the circling arrows).
5.  Enable the snippet you want to use by toggling it on.

## Snippets Included

*   **`all - checklist item appearance.css`**: Changes the appearance of checked checklist items from a strikethrough to a purple underscore.
*   **`page - two column.css`**: Provides a CSS class (`two-columns`) to create a simple two-column layout on a page.
*   **`tasks - compact tasks.css`**: A comprehensive snippet for styling tasks from the Obsidian Tasks plugin, featuring compact layouts and priority-based coloring.
*   **`ui - highlight pane in focus.css`**: Highlights the header and title of the currently active pane to make it more visible.

These snippets are provided "as-is" without any warranty. They are from my personal collection and are what I use in my own vault. While they work for me, they may not work in all situations or with all themes.

**Use these snippets at your own risk.** I am not responsible for any damage, data loss, or unexpected behavior that may result from their use. It is always a good practice to back up your vault before adding custom code.
